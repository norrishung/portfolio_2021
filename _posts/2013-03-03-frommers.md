Frommer's brand travel guides are among the most respected in the world. At Inkling, we were approached to create the digital versions of their Day By Day series guidebooks. Over the course of 8 months, we created 14 digital guidebooks that included interactive maps, local weather dashboards, slideshows, and detailed place of interest poptips.

As the technical lead on this project, I was responsible for defining and maintainable a scalable HTML/CSS framework for the entire series. I worked closely with the design lead to translate design mocks into responsive web layouts and stress-test them to make sure we both understood how the designs would respond across devices and text flow/image size edge cases. I was also resposible for building out a style guide in which our production team in India would use to build every page of the book and lead communciation with them when problems arose.

Since every book we built was essentially a complex website with dozens of page templates and commonly reused patterns, utilizing the power of SASS partials, variables, and mixins was crucial.
