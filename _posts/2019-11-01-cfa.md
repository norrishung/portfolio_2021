From 2015-2019, I worked as a designer at Code for America to improve digital public services for vulnerable populations. I worked on issues such as food assistance, healthcare, homelessness, accessibility, federal/state tax preparation, and access to city services.

## Research
    
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1" markdown="1">

I partnered with other designers and research to conduct user research studies to improve access for students, people experiencing homelessness, people with disabilities, non-english speaking communities, and community-based organizations. Many of these efforts involved collaboration with government and community partners to launch broader initiatives.

## Service Design
    
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1" markdown="1">

Using qualitative and quantitative research, I put together journey maps, service blueprints, and pain point diagrams for the services we worked on. In addition to our web services, I helped to create and design other touch points such as government lobby material, back-end interfaces, postcard mailers, paper forms, and text message / email notifications.

As a designer, I led UX/UI design, copywriting, frontend development for projects I worked on. I also led efforts to create Code for America's accessibility-forward design system.

## Quantitative Experimentation

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1" markdown="1">

I collaborated with data scientists and engineers to design and run quantitative experiments that markedly improved the approval rate of our SNAP applications by removing key barriers in the user journey.

## Design Leadership
    
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1" markdown="1">

As one of the first staff designers hired by the organization and lead designer on all of projects I worked on, I collaborated with other leaders in the organization to shape project strategy and OKRs. I helped mentor younger designers on my team and spearheaded organizational efforts around design systems, inclusive design, user research, UI copywriting, front-end best practices, and R&D. I gave talks and created installations during SF Design Week and the Code for America Summit Conference.
