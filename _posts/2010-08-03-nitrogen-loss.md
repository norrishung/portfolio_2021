Many times, I find myself thinking about what the numbers actually are when reading about environmental claims. I’ve decided to start making information graphics illustrating answers to these questions. This first graphic follows the trail of industrially produced nitrogen and the inefficiencies in the process.

I began with a static infographic below but I realized that it was not correctly illustrating the scope of the problem. As a result, I recreated the piece as an interactive graphic. As I wanted to lean more towards a graphic than an piece of interactive media, I tried to keep the complexity down and for it to neatly return back to its original form at the end.
