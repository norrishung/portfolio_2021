I began this exploration after watching the [Good Eggs video on Service Design](http://bites.goodeggs.com/posts/service-design-panel-video/). As one of the first touch points in the full user experience, the web experience sets the tone in terms of trust and confidence in the service. It plays an important part in shaping the users understanding this is not just another web store, it is a relationship with local farmers and food producers.

As I set off, I had three questions in mind:

1. How can we make users feel more connected to the products and producers as they are shopping?
1. How can we simplify the interface and choices users have to make so that they only have to make decisions as they are relevant to the immediate situation?
1. How can we showcase and engender trust in the quality of the products?

These mock ups are not answers but the start of a conversation around these questions.
